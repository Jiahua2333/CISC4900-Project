            <p>Teaching and studying in China, for one semester or one year, will provide opportunities to learn the Chinese language, make friends with the locals, and have a more in-depth understanding of Chinese culture.
                And attending China tours is a common way for Americans to see, and learn about, China. Since 2002, every year, we have been organizing China tours for educators, students, and colleagues from other different professions.
