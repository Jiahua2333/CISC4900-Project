	<p>Normally, the application deadline is <b>3 months prior</b> to the departure date. 
		However, if you miss the deadlin, do contact us. We may be able to help you. If you have any questions, please email us at <a href="mailto:UsChinaEducation@yahoo.com">UsChinaEducation@yahoo.com</a>.</p>
		<p>We do not have an age limit; people over 70 can go on the trip, as long as they are in good health and do some walking. There is not much walking for the tours, and at places such as the Forbidden City in Beijing and Terra Cotta Warriors Museum in Xi'an --only these two places involve some walking, our local tour guide can help hire wheelchair service (for about $30) for those who cannot walk or need assistance with walking.
